3D-printable storage boxes for small sets of cylindrical batteries.

Designed to be leak-resistant: the body and lid have full-length overlap and there are no unnecessary openings. They are also a very snug fit so they should be secure without any additional fasteners.

Modify the second argument to `battery_case()` to set the number of cells the case should contain. The largest sizes that I have tested out are 6 × 1 cells and 4 × 2 cells.

## Print settings

* Use an extrusion width of 0.4 mm, and 2 perimeters.
* Optionally, use no infill and no top layers — there's plenty of strength without them.
* I used PETG plastic (3D Solutech clear) with a layer height of 0.3 mm. PLA should also be fine but I have not tested the final dimensions.

You may need to adjust the clearances depending on your printer and filament characteristics.
